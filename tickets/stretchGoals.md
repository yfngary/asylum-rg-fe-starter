# Stretch Goals

These are meant to be completed once you have graduated. They include additional features you can add to this application to challenge yourself and further highlight this project on your resume. 

> For guidance on implementation, post on the Labs Slack channel which goal you want to pursue and specific questions you have about getting started. 

1. Implement authentication using Auth0 

    Auth0 is a microservice that lets you manage users, user authentication, and user authorization. Many companies when they first start out use Auth0 so they do not have to secure user data themselves. 

    Start understanding and following this [guide](https://auth0.com/blog/complete-guide-to-react-user-authentication/) by the Auth0 team. 

2. Add additional graphs using Plotly.js

    Plotly.js is a popular Javascript plotting library. Making data visualizations accurately is a difficult task and takes a team of web developers and data scientists to complete. 

    You can challenge yourself by trying implement another graph for the data provided.
